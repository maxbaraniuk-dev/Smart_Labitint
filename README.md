# Smart Project Maze

Key notes:

- start scene: "Main"
- There is no DI architecture, cause the game is pretty simple; otherwise, I implemented a simple Service Locator (Context), which links all main systems.
- Game has 3 difficulty levels, each of which can be configured in Configs/GameConfig.asset
- Best results for each difficulty level are in the "Best Results" section
- Total time spent on the project: 14 hours
